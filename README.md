# App

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install Node packages with `npm install`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * In one terminal, start RethinkDB with `rethinkdb`
  * In another terminal, start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`
  * Create new database by going to `localhost:4000/reset`
  * Elm app now running on `localhost:4000`

Credit the GraphQL integration to note89 at https://github.com/graphql-elixir/phoenix-hipster-stack, this is more or less taken directly from there!

Explore the database with GraphiQL at `localhost:4000/graphql`
